# Bitespeed Identity Reconciliation Dashboard

This React application provides a visual dashboard for Bitespeed's identity reconciliation system, allowing you to view and test contact consolidation according to the PRD requirements.

## Features

### âœ… PRD-Compliant Contact Visualization

- **Consolidated Contact Data**: Primary contacts display all linked emails and phone numbers
- **Primary Data Priority**: Primary contact's email and phone number appear first in lists
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Automatically removes duplicate emails and phone numbers while preserving order
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges show when data is consolidated from multiple contacts
- **Linked Contact Graph**: Visual connections between primary and secondary contacts

### ðŸŽ¯ Key PRD Alignments

1. **Primary Contact Emphasis**: First email and phone number are always from the primary contact
2. **Consolidated Display**: All related emails and phone numbers shown together
3. **Proper Deduplication**: Unique values only, with primary contact data prioritized
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary contacts prominently displayed with consolidated data badges

## Contact Data Structure

The application visualizes contact data according to the Bitespeed PRD:

```typescript
// Primary contacts show consolidated data
{
  primaryContactId: string,
  emails: string[],        // Primary contact's email appears first
  phoneNumbers: string[],  // Primary contact's phone appears first
  secondaryContactIds: string[]
}
```

## Visual Elements

- **Primary Contacts** (ðŸ‘‘): Show consolidated data with golden crown icon
- **Secondary Contacts** (ðŸ‘¤): Individual contact information
- **Consolidated Badge**: Appears when primary contact has multiple linked contacts
- **Primary Data Highlight**: First email/phone highlighted in primary contacts
- **Connection Lines**: Visual links between primary and secondary contacts
